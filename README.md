# INJI VCI Client

The **Inji-Vci-Client-iOS-Swift** is a Swift-based library built to simplify credential issuance via [OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance (OID4VCI)](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html) protocol.
It supports **Issuer Initiated (Credential Offer)** and **Wallet Initiated (Trusted Issuer)** flows, with secure proof handling, PKCE support, and custom error handling.

---

## Specifications supported

The implementation follows
- OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance 1.0
- OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance draft 13 compatibility for issuers that still expose the older metadata and request/response format

## Features

- Request credentials from OID4VCI-compliant credential issuers
- Supports both:
  - Issuer Initiated Flow (Credential Offer Flow).
  - Wallet Initiated Flow (Trusted Issuer Flow).
- Authorization server discovery for both flows
- PKCE-compliant OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow (RFC 7636)
  - PKCE session is managed internally by the library
- Well-defined **exception handling** with `VCI-XXX` error codes (see more on [this](#-error-handling))
- Support for multiple Credential formats:
  - `ldp_vc`
  - `mso_mdoc`
  - `vc+sd-jwt` / `dc+sd-jwt`
  - `jwt_vc_json`

[//]: # (The reference for PDI  is intentionally pointing to kotlin library master branch to be release agnostic, as the PDI support is available for both kotlin and swift libraries. The documentation for PDI support is also common for both libraries, hence it is placed in the common doc folder in the root of the repository.)
- Presentation During Issuance (PDI) support for both download flows (For more details on PDI support, please refer to the [Presentation During Issuance documentation](https://github.com/inji/inji-vci-client/tree/master/doc/presentation-during-issuance-support.md))

> Consumer of this library is responsible for processing and rendering the credential after it is downloaded.

## Library implementations available in:
This library is officially supported and available in both Kotlin and Swift, ensuring seamless integration across Android and iOS platforms. The references for both implementations are provided below:

* [Kotlin](https://github.com/inji/inji-vci-client/tree/master/kotlin)
* [Swift](.)

## 📦 Installation

Add VCIClient to your Swift Package Manager dependencies:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/inji/inji-vci-client-ios-swift", from: "1.0.0")
```

## What's New in 1.0.0

Version `1.0.0` adds support for the final **OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance 1.0** specification while retaining backward compatibility with OID4VCI draft 13. The highlights below cover everything added since `0.7.0`:

- **OID4VCI 1.0 support with retained draft 13 support** - The library auto-detects the spec version of the issuer from its metadata and builds the credential request accordingly, so a single integration works against both 1.0 and draft 13 issuers.
- **Credential download methods renamed (and now return multiple credentials)** - `fetchCredentialUsingCredentialOffer` and `fetchCredentialFromTrustedIssuer` are now `fetchCredentialsUsingCredentialOffer` and `fetchCredentialsFromTrustedIssuer`.
- **New `getProofs` callback** - The single-proof `getProofJwt` callback is replaced by `getProofs`, which returns a `CredentialRequestProofs` object and allows supplying one or more proofs in a single credential request, as per OID4VCI 1.0.
- **`CredentialResponse` now exposes a `credentials` list** - Instead of a single `credential` field, the response carries a `credentials` list (`[CredentialItem]`), aligning with the OID4VCI 1.0 credential response structure.
- **Legacy APIs removed** - `requestCredentialByCredentialOffer`, `requestCredentialFromTrustedIssuer`, and `requestCredential` have been removed. Migrate to the `fetchCredentials*` methods.
- **Structured error handling** - `VCIClientException` now carries `issuerErrorCode` and `issuerErrorDescription` alongside `code` and `message`, and `code` resolves to the root error code across the cause chain, so consumers can distinguish library failures from issuer/authorization-server error payloads (see [Error Handling](#-error-handling)).
- **Issuer identity validation** - Issuer metadata fetches now validate that the `credential_issuer` returned by the well-known endpoint matches the requested issuer, per [OID4VCI Section 13.5](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html#section-13.5).

## 🏗️ Construction of VCIClient instance

- The `VCIClient` is constructed with a `traceabilityId` which is used to track the session and traceability of the credential request.

```swift
let traceabilityId = "sample-trace-id"
let vciClient = VCIClient(traceabilityId: traceabilityId)
```

#### Parameters

| Name            | Type   | Required | Default Value | Description                          |
|-----------------|--------|----------|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| traceabilityId  | String | Yes      | N/A           | Unique identifier for the session    |

## 📖 API Overview

### 1. Obtain Issuer Metadata

Retrieve the issuer metadata from the credential issuer's well-known endpoint.

#### Parameters

| Name             | Type   | Required | Default Value | Description                  |
|------------------|--------|----------|---------------|------------------------------|
| credentialIssuer | String | Yes      | N/A           | URI of the Credential Issuer |

#### Returns

`[String: Any]` dictionary containing details like `credential_endpoint`, `credential_issuer`, and other issuer metadata from the well-known endpoint of Credential Issuer, which can be used by the consumer to display Issuer information, etc.

> Note: This method does not parse the metadata, it simply returns the raw Network response of well-known endpoint as a `[String: Any]`.

#### Example Usage

```swift
let issuerMetadata: [String: Any] = try await vciClient.getIssuerMetadata(credentialIssuer: "https://example.com/issuer")
    
//the response looks similar to this
[String: Any] = [
    "credential_issuer": "https://example.com/issuer",
    "credential_endpoint": "https://example.com/issuer/credential"
]
```

### 2. Obtain Credential Configurations Supported

Retrieve credential configurations supported for given issuer from its well-known endpoint.

#### Parameters

| Name             | Type   | Required | Default Value | Description                  |
|------------------|--------|----------|---------------|------------------------------|
| credentialIssuer | String | Yes      | N/A           | URI of the Credential Issuer |

#### Returns
Map of `credential_configurations_supported` objects containing details like `format`, `scope` and other configuration
information from the well-known endpoint of Credential Issuer, which can be used by the consumer to display supported
credential types, etc.

> Note: This method does not parse the metadata, it simply returns the raw Network response of well-known endpoint as a `[String: Any]`.

#### Example Usage

```swift
let credentialConfigurationsSupported : [String: Any] = try await vciClient.getCredentialConfigurationsSupported(
    credentialIssuer: "https://example.com/issuer"
)

//The response looks similar to this
[String: Any] = [
    "credentialConfigId-1": [
        "format": "ldp_vc",
        "credential_definition": [
            "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "ExampleCredential"]
        ]
    ],
    "credentialConfigId-2": [
        "format": "mso_mdoc",
        "doctype": "org.iso.18013.5.1.mDL"
    ],
    "credentialConfigId-3": [
        "format": "jwt_vc_json",
        "credential_definition": [
            "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "ExampleJwtCredential"],
        ],
        "scope": "ExampleJwtCredential"
    ]
]
```

### 3. Request Credential

Version `1.0.0` exposes two public credential download APIs:

- `fetchCredentialsUsingCredentialOffer(...)` for issuer-initiated flows
- `fetchCredentialsFromTrustedIssuer(...)` for wallet-initiated flows

Both methods use the OpenID4VCI 1.0-facing proof callback and return a normalized plural response. When an issuer still behaves like Draft-13, the library keeps the compatibility routing internal and still returns the 1.0 response shape.

### 3.1 Request Credential using Credential Offer

#### fetchCredentialsUsingCredentialOffer

- Method: `fetchCredentialsUsingCredentialOffer`
- This method allows you to fetch credential(s) using a credential offer, which can be either an embedded JSON or a URI pointing to the credential offer.
- It supports both **Pre-Authorization** and **Authorization** flows.
- The library handles the PKCE flow internally.
- User-trust based credential download supported through `onCheckIssuerTrust` callback.
- This method is the recommended way to request credential using credential offer.

```

#### requestCredentialFromTrustedIssuer (removed in 1.0)

> ⚠️ **Removed in 1.0**: `requestCredentialFromTrustedIssuer` (deprecated since `0.7.0`) has been removed. Use [`fetchCredentialsFromTrustedIssuer`](#fetchcredentialsfromtrustedissuer) instead, which supports the different authorization methods (Redirect to Web / Presentation During Issuance).

##### Authorizations

The `authorizationMethods` parameter is a list of supported wallet authorization flows. The library currently supports two authorization flows - _Redirect To Web_ and _Presentation During Issuance_.

1. Redirect To Web (for Authorization flow)

Redirect the user to the authorization endpoint in a web view or browser and return the authorization response parameters after successful authorization.

**Parameters :**

| Name        | Type                | Required | Default Value | Description                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-------------|---------------------|----------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| openWebPage | OpenWebPageCallback | Yes      | N/A           | Callback that opens the authorization endpoint and returns the authorization response parameters such as `code` and `state`                                                         |

**Example usage**
```swift
AuthorizationMethod.redirectToWeb(
    openWebPage: { authorizationEndpoint in
        let result: [String: Any] = openWebViewAndGetResult(authorizationEndpoint)
        return result
    }
)
```
> Note: The Redirect to Web flow for an interactive authorization flow is exposed as an experimental API, and is expected to be improved in future releases.

2. Presentation During Issuance

Presentation During Issuance allows the wallet to present a verifiable presentation to the credential issuer during the issuance flow, which can be used by the issuer to verify certain claims about the user before issuing the credential. The authorization for the download here is presentation of another credential (or a verifiable presentation) instead of user interaction-based authorization as in Redirect To Web flow.

###### Specification Reference

This implementation follows - [OpenID4VCI v1.1 Specification Commit](https://github.com/openid/OpenID4VCI/blob/31636e9bb7f0eef6933175e1e41c78ce79a69783/1.1/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_1.md)

> Note:
> - While this library primarily implements OpenID4VCI 1.0 and draft 13, the Presentation During Issuance feature follows the v1.1 specification as mentioned above.
> - For Presentation During Issuance, this library internally uses [inji-openid4vp-ios-swift](https://github.com/inji/inji-openid4vp-ios-swift) to construct the VP and handle the presentation exchange with the issuer.

### 3.3 requestCredential (removed in 1.0)

> ⚠️ **Removed in 1.0**: The low-level `requestCredential` method (deprecated since `0.7.0`) has been removed. Please migrate to [`fetchCredentialsUsingCredentialOffer()`](#fetchcredentialsusingcredentialoffer) or [`fetchCredentialsFromTrustedIssuer()`](#fetchcredentialsfromtrustedissuer), which fetch the issuer metadata, build the credential request (for OID4VCI 1.0 or draft 13), and download the credential for you.

## 🛑 Error Handling

All exceptions thrown by the library are subclasses of `VCIClientException`.  
They carry structured fields that help consumers identify whether the failure came from the library itself, a wrapped library exception, or an upstream server response.

### `VCIClientException` fields

| Field                     | Type      | Meaning |
|---------------------------|-----------|---------|
| `code`                    | `String`  | The library-defined `VCI-*` error code. When the exception wraps another `VCIClientException`, `code` carries the **root** code resolved from the cause chain; otherwise it is the exception's own code. |
| `message`                 | `String`  | Human-readable summary of the failure, ready for logging or diagnostics. |
| `issuerErrorCode`         | `String?` | The issuer or authorization server `error` value when the remote service returned a structured OAuth/OID4VCI style error response. |
| `issuerErrorDescription`  | `String?` | The upstream `error_description` value when available. If the response body is not parseable JSON, the raw response body may be propagated here for diagnostics. |

### Structured error handling

> New in `1.0.0`: if you are upgrading from `0.7.0`, where only `code` and `message` were reliably available, the structured fields below are new.

The error model exposes the following fields so consumers can react precisely to failures:

- `code` identifies the root library failure. When an exception wraps another library exception, `code` resolves to the deepest `VCI-*` code in the cause chain rather than the wrapper's own code.
- `issuerErrorCode` captures the upstream server `error` field when present.
- `issuerErrorDescription` captures the upstream `error_description`, or the raw error body when structured parsing is not possible.

This means consumers can distinguish between:

- the original underlying library failure (surfaced through `code` even across wrapping),
- and a server-originated error payload returned by the issuer or authorization server.

#### Recommendations for consumers

- If your integration only switches on `code`, it will continue to work — and `code` now reflects the root failure category even when the exception is wrapped at the API boundary.
- If you want to infer server-side failures, use `issuerErrorCode` and `issuerErrorDescription` rather than parsing `message`.
- If you want better observability, log all three fields: `code`, `issuerErrorCode`, and `issuerErrorDescription`.
- If you want better retry and UX decisions, use `code` for the top-level category and `issuerErrorCode` for server-specific remediation.

### What each field means for consumers

- Use `code` for primary client-side branching, telemetry dimensions, and product analytics. It identifies the root library failure even when the exception is wrapped.
- Use `issuerErrorCode` to decide whether a failure is recoverable through user action, such as re-authentication, retry, or correcting a request.
- Use `issuerErrorDescription` for logs, support tooling, and developer diagnostics. Avoid showing it directly to end users without sanitization because it may contain server-specific text.

Some public API methods may wrap an internal `VCIClientException` into another `VCIClientException` before rethrowing it. This improves consistency at the API boundary without losing the root cause.

Example:

- `getIssuerMetadata()` may wrap the failure at the API boundary, but `code` still resolves to `VCI-009` when the underlying failure was an issuer metadata fetch error.
- `issuerErrorCode` may contain a remote value such as `invalid_token` if the upstream endpoint returned it.

### Recommended consumer handling

```swift
do {
    let credentialResponse = try await vciClient.fetchCredentialsUsingCredentialOffer(
        credentialOffer: credentialOffer,
        clientMetadata: clientMetadata,
        getTxCode: getTxCode,
        authorizationMethods: authorizationMethods,
        getTokenResponse: getTokenResponse,
        getProofs: getProofs
    )
} catch let error as VCIClientException {
    logger.error(
        "VCI request failed. code=\(error.code), " +
        "issuerCode=\(error.issuerErrorCode ?? "nil"), issuerDescription=\(error.issuerErrorDescription ?? "nil"), " +
        "message=\(error.message)"
    )

    switch error.code {
    case "VCI-007":
        showRetryMessage()
    case "VCI-003":
        triggerTokenRefresh()
    case "VCI-011":
        showAuthorizationFailure()
    default:
        showGenericFailure()
    }
}
```
